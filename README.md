# Flags
 Talkative Traveler â€” Language app (started with the idea of coding the world flags)

I just wanted to make some world flags, and then I got interested and added some extra stuff to make it look like a language learning website.

Note: I did not make the Korean flag on my own. I simply made some tweaks. Credits go to Avaz Bokiev for the gaps in the stripes and the overlapping circles in the yin-yang: https://codepen.io/samarkandiy/pen/neLPoA
